# LLDAP-Discord

A Discord bot that integrates with GraphQL and LDAP to manage monthly subscribers by adding and removing their access to an LDAP group.
Designed for and tested using the [Lightweight LDAP Project](https://github.com/lldap/lldap)

## Features
- **Automated Subscription Management**: Grants and revokes access based on the subscriber role.
- **Self-Service Account Creation**: Users can register their own LLDAP accounts via a simple Discord command.
- **Admin Controls**: Sync subscribers manually when needed.
- **Designed for Media Servers**: Compatible with Emby and Jellyfin authentication via LDAP.

## Environment Configuration
To configure the bot, create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```ini
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=DISCORDTOKEN
LDAP_SERVER_URL=ldap://yoursite.com:3890
LDAP_BIND_DN=uid=admin,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
LDAP_BASE_DN=dc=example,dc=com
LLDAP_LOGIN_URL=https://YourLLDAPWebPage.com
SUBSCRIBER_ROLE_NAME=Subscriber
SUBSCRIBERS_GROUP_ID=4
LIFETIME_ROLE_NAME=Lifetime
LIFETIME_GROUP_ID=5
SERVICE_NAME=YourServiceName
PUBLIC_URL=(Optional) The public facing URL of your auth system (ex: authelia)
```

Note that `PUBLIC_URL` is not required and will default to the value of `LLDAP_LOGIN_URL` if not set. This makes it easy to integrate the bot with a different authentication frontend, such as Authentik or Authelia.
Additionally, the `SUBSCRIBER_ROLE_NAME` and `LIFETIME_ROLE_NAME` are customizable, and the messages the bot sends will automatically update based on these values. An example use case is if you wanted to use the bot to assign service admins based on discord roles. The bot is also able to assign multiple roles to a single user.

## Docker Install

Create ``docker-compose.yml``, populate the relevant environmental variables with your server info, then simply run ``docker compose up -d``
```
version: '3.8'
services:
  lldap-discord:
    image: watlingj/lldap-discord:latest
    container_name: LLDAP-Discord
    command: python main.py
    working_dir: /usr/src/app
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
      - DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=DISCORDTOKEN
      - LDAP_SERVER_URL=ldap://yoursite.com:3890
      - LDAP_BIND_DN=uid=admin,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
      - LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD=PASSWORD
      - LDAP_BASE_DN=dc=example,dc=com
      - LLDAP_LOGIN_URL=https://YourLLDAPWebPage.com
      - SUBSCRIBER_ROLE_NAME=Subscriber
      - SUBSCRIBERS_GROUP_ID=4
      - LIFETIME_ROLE_NAME=Lifetime
      - LIFETIME_GROUP_ID=5
      - SERVICE_NAME=YourServiceName
      - PUBLIC_URL=https://authelia.yourdomain.com (OPTIONAL)
```


## Important Notes
This bot **does not** handle role subscription management. You must use a separate subscription/payment service such as [Upgrade.Chat](https://upgrade.chat/). The bot operates on the assumption that users are already assigned the subscriber role.

Once assigned, users can register an LLDAP account using the `/register` command. They will receive a temporary password and a link to update it via a private message:

## Available Commands

### User Commands
#### Register as a Subscriber
```sh
/register <email> [username] (optional)
```
Allows users with the subscriber role to create an LLDAP account.

### Admin Commands
#### Manually Sync Subscribers
```sh
/sync_subscribers
```
Forces a synchronization process in case of any discrepancies.

## Integration with Media Servers
This bot was developed to enable subscription-based access to **Emby** and **Jellyfin**. Below are the required LDAP search filters:

### Jellyfin LDAP Search Filter
```ini
(|(memberof=cn=lifetime,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com)(memberof=cn=subscribers,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))
```

### Emby User Search Filter
```ini
(&(uid={0})(|(memberof=cn=lifetime,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com)(memberof=cn=subscribers,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com)))
```

## Updates


### V1.5
- Lifetime Subscriber Role Support
